## Bachelor's Final Project – Streamlit Application

Welcome to the repository for the Fake News Detection System, a key component of a Bachelor's Final Project focused on identifying and analyzing misinformation. The application is designed to explore various machine learning and transformer-based models for evaluating the truthfulness of claims, integrated into an interactive web interface using Streamlit.

# 📁 Project Structure

## Inside the FAKENEWS_APP folder, you'll find modular components for the complete system:

- Pages/ – Individual pages for navigation within the Streamlit app (e.g., dashboard, model results, explanations).
- Models/ – Pretrained or custom-trained ML and transformer-based models for claim classification.
- Reports/ – Locally generated evaluation reports and visualizations.
- Utils/ – Helper functions for data processing, model loading, and prediction logic.
- app.py – application running file
